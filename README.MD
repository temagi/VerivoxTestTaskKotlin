## Bug:

As I know, German postcodes should be in range `01067 â€“ 99998`
I decide to check numbers our of range and the code `99999` returns an error, as expected
But the code `01066` returns a success (Dresden, as well as `01067`) - https://service.verivox.de/geo/latestv2/cities/01066/.
I'm not sure, but it looks like a bug, because at least for the streets request it returns an error - https://service.verivox.de/geo/latestv2/cities/01066/Dresden/streets
